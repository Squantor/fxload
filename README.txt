FXLOAD UTILITY

This program is conveniently able to download firmware into FX and FX2
ez-usb devices. It is intended to be invoked by hotplug scripts when
the unprogrammed device appears on the bus.

Primarily as an aid for developers, this can also be used to update
firmware on devices which boot from I2C serial EEPROMs.  For that
use, as well as downloading firmware to all other off-chip memory,
a second stage loader must first be downloaded.
